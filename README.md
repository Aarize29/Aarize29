🚀 About Me

> “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” – Harold Abelson

I’m Shams Aarize Siddique — a curious builder, backend thinker, and full-stack developer with a deep appreciation for clean architecture and developer empathy. I love writing code that scales, automates infrastructure, and solves real-world problems.

🌍 I'm currently working remotely with US-based teams and have:
- 🛠 Built infrastructure for analytics platforms using AWS CDK, Lambda, Cognito, and SQS
- 💰 Cut cloud costs by 90% using Zero Trust & IAM DB access
- ⚙️ Designed and deployed full-stack services using React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL
- 🚀 Automated production-grade CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions and Docker
- 🧠 Combined ML APIs with scalable UI systems (OpenAI, custom ML models)

---

🎯 Current Focus

- Advancing my cloud infrastructure design skills with AWS
- Building scalable React-based SaaS UIs
- Designing better DevOps pipelines for rapid iteration
- Growing as a backend/system engineer
- Learning distributed systems and AI production workflows
